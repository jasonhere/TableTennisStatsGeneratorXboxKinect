<p>About the Project:
Sports Statistics Visualization</p>

<p>This represents the implementation of my Hawkeye inspired Masters project of a cost effective method to generate statistics suitable for sports broadcasting and player strategy analysis similar to tools such as Hawkeye innovations used in Cricket and Tennis.
The intended results of this project was to build a complete software tool using C++, openGL and openCV coupled with Microsoft Kinect to generate various player specific data. Table tennis was the chosen sport taken as reference to generate statistics for, as it is played indoors and confirms to the scope and hardware dependencies of the project.
Various statistics that can be generated out of this implemented tool are 2D Pitch locations of balls, 2D Percentage distribution of pitch locations representing coverage patterns of a player, 3D Height bar graph representing the density of ball pitch locations, 3D ball trajectory for all the rallies, 3D speed pitch map representing the instantaneous speed at the pitch locations and finally revolutions per minute imparted on the ball through the course of a rally. The tool possesses high portability and flexibility with the ability to save the generated data in XML format for later analysis at a different place or time without the need to connect to the kinect hardware. The tool also provides setup options to setup the tracking device providing ease of access to the user in utilizing this tool indoors within their home or coaching centres.</p>
