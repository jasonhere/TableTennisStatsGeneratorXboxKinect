Table tennis was the chosen sport taken as reference to generate statistics for, as it is played indoors and confirms to the scope and hardware dependencies of the project.\r\nVarious statistics that can be generated out of this implemented tool are 2D Pitch locations of balls, 2D Percentage distribution of pitch locations representing coverage patterns of a player, 3D Height bar graph representing the density of ball pitch locations, 3D ball trajectory for all the rallies, 3D speed pitch map representing the instantaneous speed at the pitch locations and finally revolutions per minute imparted on the ball through the course of a rally. The tool possesses high portability and flexibility with the ability to save the generated data in XML format for later analysis at a different place or time without the need to connect to the kinect hardware. The tool also provides setup options to setup the tracking device providing ease of access to the user in utilizing this tool indoors within their home or coaching centres.\r\n\r\nPLEASE Consider Crediting me as Santosh K,MSc Computer Animation and Vfx, Bournemouth University, if you plan to reproduce this code anywhere.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
